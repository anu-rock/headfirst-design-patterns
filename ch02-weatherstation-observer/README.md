# WeatherStation

This application uses **Observer** pattern to send updates to observers (or listeners) on change of a subject's (observable) state.

The Observer Pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all of its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

The pattern is commonly used to implement event-driven programming such as in JavaScript events and Swing's action listeners.

Design Principles learned:

- Principle 1: Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact.
