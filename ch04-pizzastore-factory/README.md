This application uses **Factory Method** and **Abstract Factory** patterns to allow us to depend on abstractions rather than concrete classes to create a loosely coupled program.

The Factory Method pattern defines an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to the subclasses.

The Abstract Factory pattern provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

Design Principles learned:

- Principle 1: Depend on abstractions. Do not depend on concrete classes.
